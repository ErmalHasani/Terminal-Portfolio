The Portfolio Terminal is an interactive web-based terminal built to showcase a developer's skills, projects, and personal information in a terminal-like interface. It combines functionality with aesthetics, featuring ASCII banners, dynamic typing effects, and commands that simulate a Linux shell experience.
